# controllers-core
Provides the core for a simple controller framework

The framework must be a proof of concept.
The point is to use the same core in different controllers serving different interfaces (e.g. HTTP, WebSockets, CLI, etc.)
Next step will be creating middleware to serve the different interfaces and then to create boot-up files for them.
The final target is to create fully working controllers (as Controller in the MVC point of view).
